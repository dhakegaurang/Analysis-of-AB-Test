Udacity Nanodegree Term 1 Final Project : Analyse AB Test

Summary
This is an A/B testing assignment completed for Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. The project consisted of understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and helping the company understand through statistical conclusions, if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
